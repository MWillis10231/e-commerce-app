Known issues:

Orders section is super ugly.
Filters only work on the search function (an issue with my routing)
When you logout, it doesn't clear your cart (neither in express nor in the app)
Editing your profile does nothing at present
It's not at all optimised for mobile (just like real Amazon)

Improvements for future:

A logo (design in progress)
A nicer looking rating system with stars
More unique / personalised products (even if we use fewer)
Better sign-up system - maybe with email verification
Option to enter an "address" for delivery
